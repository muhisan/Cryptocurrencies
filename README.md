# Cryptocurrencies
## Project Overview

In this project Martha, a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting, needs our help.
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. 
The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked Matha to create a report that includes what 
cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data Martha will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. 
Since there is no known output for what Martha is looking for, we have decided to use unsupervised learning.
To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. we will use data visualizations to share our findings with the board.
